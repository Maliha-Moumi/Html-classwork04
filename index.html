	      <h2>Facebook Marketing</h2> 
    <p>If you’re a brand hoping to thrive on social media, mastering Facebook marketing is going to be key.More than 2.8 billion people use the platform every single month. That’s a lot of potential eyeballs on your business.Because here’s the thing about Facebook: while you might think it’s just a place where your aunt can leave cryptic comments on your vacation pics, it’s also a place for audiences to connect with businesses big and small.In fact, two-thirds of Facebook users report visiting a local business Facebook Page at least once a week. This digital marketplace is downright bustling, if it’s not too bold of us to say.</p>

    	     <h2>Linkedin Marketing</h2>
    <p>LinkedIn is less about selling or marketing your products and services than other social platforms. On LinkedIn, blatantly pushing your business, spamming and obvious hard-selling are highly frowned upon. This is why having a marketing strategy specific to the platform is so important. Because the network consists of a totally different audience, LinkedIn marketing requires a different approach to get the results you want.According to Sprout Social, businesses marketing on LinkedIn generate 277% more leads on average than those engaged in Facebook marketing alone. Surveyed B2B marketers also said that LinkedIn is responsible for 80% of their social media leads. Used appropriately, LinkedIn is an effective marketing tool that can take your business to the next level.</p>

    <h2>What is website?</h2>
    <p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia.com website:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">
    <p>A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com"> wikipedia.org</a>,<a href="https://www.google.com"> google.com</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com"> amazon.com.</a></p>
    <p>All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees.Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a web browser.</p>
